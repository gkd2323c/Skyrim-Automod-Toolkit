## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Archive Editing Operations** - Comprehensive suite for modifying BSA/BA2 archives without full repackaging
    - `archive add-files` - Add new files to existing archives with directory structure preservation
        - `--base-dir` parameter for explicit path control
        - Auto-detection of common parent directory
        - Preserves folder hierarchy (e.g., meshes/mymod/weapon.nif)
    - `archive remove-files` - Remove files by pattern from archives
        - Filter patterns: `*.esp`, `scripts/*`, specific files
        - Preserves remaining archive structure
    - `archive replace-files` - Replace matching files from source directory
        - Optional filter patterns for selective replacement
        - Useful for script updates, texture patches
    - `archive update-file` - Convenience wrapper for single file updates
        - Faster than full replace-files for single operations
    - `archive extract-file` - Extract single file without unpacking entire archive
        - Significantly faster than full extraction for single file access

- **Archive Maintenance Operations**
    - `archive merge` - Combine multiple archives with conflict tracking
        - Reports conflicts when files exist in multiple archives
        - Later archives overwrite earlier ones
        - Tracks files per source archive
    - `archive validate` - Check archive integrity
        - Reports file count, size, archive type
        - Warns about mismatches or corruption
        - Useful before distribution
    - `archive optimize` - Repack with compression and report size savings
        - Defragments and compresses archives
        - Reports original vs optimized size
        - Percentage savings calculation
    - `archive diff` - Compare two archive versions
        - Shows added, removed, modified, and unchanged files
        - Useful for understanding what patches change

### Fixed

- **Critical archive editing bugs** - 5 major bugs preventing archive editing from working:
    1. **BSArch overwrite bug**: BSArch cannot pack to existing files
        - Added `File.Delete(archivePath)` before repacking in add-files, remove-files, replace-files
    2. **Temp directory cleanup bug**: BSArch created archives in temp directory (immediately deleted)
        - Added `Path.GetFullPath(archivePath)` to convert relative paths to absolute
        - Affects: add-files, remove-files, replace-files, merge, optimize
    3. **Merge extract directory bug**: Merge created temp path but didn't create directory
        - Added `Directory.CreateDirectory(tempExtractDir)` before extraction
    4. **Merge/Optimize output path bug**: Same temp directory issue as edit operations
        - Added `Path.GetFullPath(outputPath)` in MergeArchivesAsync and OptimizeAsync
    5. **ListFiles limit=0 bug**: limit=0 broke immediately instead of showing all files
        - Changed condition to check `limit.Value > 0` before breaking
        - Affected validate and diff operations which use limit=0 for "show all"

### Changed

- **Documentation comprehensively updated** for archive editing
    - `.claude/skills/skyrim-archive/skill.md` - Full command reference and workflows
    - `docs/llm-guide.md` - Complete Archive Operations section with examples
    - `docs/llm-init-prompt.md` - Updated quick reference for AI assistants
    - All version references removed to keep documentation version-agnostic

### Developer Notes

- Extract-modify-repack workflow pattern used for all editing operations
- All operations support `--preserve-compression` flag (defaults to true)
- JSON output for all operations with structured Result types
- Temp directory cleanup in finally blocks for safety
- ~500 lines of new code across ArchiveService and ArchiveCommands

### Known Limitations

- Archive editing requires BSArch tool (auto-downloads on first use)
- Edit operations take time for large archives (extract → modify → repack)
- BSArch only supports SSE, LE, FO4, FO76 archive formats

## [1.7.1] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed

- **`esp find-record` wildcard pattern bug** - The `--search "*"` parameter now correctly matches all records of the specified type
    - **Bug:** Wildcard pattern was treated as literal asterisk character, returning empty results even when records existed
    - **Impact:** Commands like `esp find-record --type spell --search "*"` would return `[]` despite `esp info` showing "Spells: 2"
    - **Fix:** Added wildcard handling - `*` now matches all records of filtered type while preserving substring search for other patterns
    - **Testing:** Verified with test plugin containing 2 spells - wildcard now returns both, partial search still works correctly

        - Creates override patch automatically
        - Hardcoded comparison value of 1.0 (suitable for most boolean checks)
    - `esp remove-condition` - Remove specific conditions by index
        - Remove single or multiple conditions (comma-separated indices)
        - Preserves all other record properties
        - Creates clean override patch
